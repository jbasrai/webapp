<h1 style="text-align:center;">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy page ("Policy") for the NuMose website www.numose.com ("Website" or "Site") which is operated by NuMose. This Policy creates an agreement between you and NuMose that applies to your visiting and use of the Website. The Website provides a web search engine geared towards practicing physicians who are seeking the most up to date and relevant articles on any disease process.</p>
 
<p>We take your privacy very seriously. NuMose provides this Policy to explain how we use and disclose information we collect through the Site.</p>  

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that NuMose does not own or control, or to individuals that NuMose does not employ or manage.</p>  
 
<p>By visiting the Website you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h2>Information Collected by NuMose</h2>
<p><i>Non-personally identifying information</i> <br></p>
<h3>Traffic Data.</h3>
 <p>NuMose may collect a variety of visitor data such as domain name or IP addresses, browser settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, web pages displayed and clickstream data (collectively “Visitor Data”). The NuMose internal servers and software automatically recognize Visitor Data. No Personally Identifiable Information is collected in this process. The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site at specific intervals (collectively “Traffic Data”).<br>
We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.<br></p>
<h3>Cookies.</h3>  
<p>NuMose may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow NuMose to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access the Site about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications. The cookies are used primarily to improve the overall usability of the Site.  NuMose does not capture Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.  The cookies do not track you if you return to the Site.  They are temporary and will be deleted when you exit your browser.  You can prevent cookies from being placed on your computer by accessing your browser's preferences menu and deleting existing cookies. There also are commercial programs available to help you manage cookies. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site, may be limited.  You can also choose not to have your data used by Google Analytics by downloading their opt-out browser add-on.<br></p>
<h3>Do Not Track.</h3>  
<p>Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not currently respond to DNT signals. We do, however, provide you notice of the tracking by third parties in this Policy.<br></p>
<h3>Web Beacons.</h3> 
<p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br></p>
<h3>Third Party Tracking.</h3>
 <p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.   We do not have access or control over these technologies.  We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.<br>
We may collect the information of 3rd party individuals as necessary, such as to register authorized contacts to access their NuMose account.  NuMose uses this information for the sole purpose of administering its services for our customers, and does not use such information for any other reason.<br>
<br></p>
