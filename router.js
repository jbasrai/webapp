By definition, an aneurysm is a localized or diffuse dilation of an artery with a diameter at least 50% greater than the normal size of the artery. | Most aortic aneurysms (AAs) occur in the abdominal aorta; these are termed abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Although most abdominal aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, the most common complication remains life-threatening rupture with hemorrhage. Aneurysmal degeneration that occurs in the thoracic aorta is termed a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). Aneurysms that coexist in both segments of the aorta (thoracic and abdominal) are termed thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAAs). TAAs and TAAAs are also at risk for rupture. A recent population-based study suggests an increasing prevalence of TAAs. TAAs are subdivided into the following three groups depending on location: | Ascending aortic aneurysms | Aortic arch aneurysms | Descending thoracic aneurysms or thoracoabdominal aneurysms | webmd.ads2.defineAd({id:'ads-pos-520',pos: 520}); | Aneurysms that involve the ascending aorta may extend as proximally as the aortic annulus and as distally as the innominate artery, whereas descending thoracic aneurysms begin beyond the left subclavian artery. Arch aneurysms are as the name implies. | Dissection is another condition that may affect the thoracic aorta. An intimal tear causes separation of the walls of the aorta. A false passage for blood develops between the layers of the aorta. This false lumen may extend into branches of the aorta in the chest or abdomen, causing malperfusion, ischemia, or occlusion with resultant complications. The dissection can also progress proximally, to involve the aortic sinus, aortic valve, and coronary arteries. Dissection can lead to aneurysmal change and early or late rupture. A chronic dissection is one that is diagnosed more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Dissection should not be termed dissecting aneurysm, because it can occur with or without aneurysmal enlargement of the aorta. | The shape of an aortic aneurysm is either saccular or fusiform. A fusiform (or true) aneurysm has a uniform shape with a symmetrical dilatation that involves the entire circumference of the aortic wall. A saccular aneurysm is a localized outpouching of the aortic wall, and it is the shape of a pseudoaneurysm. | For patient education resources, see | Aortic Aneurysm | . | Treatment | Treatment of AAAs, TAAAs, and TAAs involves surgical repair in good-risk patients with aneurysms that have reached a size sufficient to warrant repair. Surgical repair may involve endovascular stent grafting (in suitable candidates) or traditional open surgical repair. | webmd.ads2.defineAd({id:'ads-pos-420',pos: 420}); | The development of treatment modalities for thoracic aneurysms followed successful treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Estes' 1950 report revealed that the 3-y survival rate for patients with untreated abdominal aortic aneurysms was only 50%, with two thirds of deaths resulting from | aneurysmal rupture | . | [1] | Since then, increased attempts were made to devise methods of durable repair. | Most of these initial successful repairs involved the use of preserved aortic allografts, thus triggering the establishment of numerous aortic allograft banks. Simultaneously, Gross and colleagues successfully used allografts to treat complex thoracic aortic coarctations, including those with aneurysmal involvement. | [2] | In 1951, Lam and Aram reported the resection of a descending thoracic aneurysm with allograft replacement. | [3] | Ascending aortic replacement required the development of cardiopulmonary bypass and was first performed in 1956 by Cooley and DeBakey. | [4] | They successfully replaced the ascending aorta with an aortic allograft. Successful replacement of the aortic arch, with its inherent risk of cerebral ischemia, was understandably more challenging and was not reported until 1957 by DeBakey et al. | [5] | Although the use of aortic allografts as aortic replacement was widely accepted in the early 1950s, the search for synthetic substitutes was well underway. Dacron was introduced by DeBakey. By 1955, Deterling and Bhonslay believed that Dacron was the best material for aortic substitution. | [6] | Numerous types of intricately woven hemostatic grafts have since been developed and are now used much more extensively than their allograft counterparts. Such Dacron grafts are used to replace ascending, arch, thoracic, and thoracoabdominal aortic segments. | However, some patients required replacement of the aortic root, as well. Subsequently, combined operations that replaced the ascending aneurysm in conjunction with replacement of the aortic valve and reimplantation of the coronary arteries were performed by Bentall and De Bono in 1968, using a mechanical valve with a Dacron conduit. | [7] | Ross, in 1962, and Barratt-Boyes, in 1964, successfully implanted the aortic homograft in the orthotopic position. | [8, 9] | In 1985, Sievers reported the use of stentless porcine aortic roots. | [10] | More recently, less invasive therapy for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm have been developed. Dake et al reported the first endovascular thoracic aortic repair in 1994. | [11] | In March 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first thoracic aortic stent graft, the GORE TAG graft (W.L. Gore and Associates; Flagstaff, AZ). | [12] | Since 2005, 2 other devices have gained FDA approval: the Talent Thoracic endograft (Medtronic; Santa Rosa, CA) and the Cook TX2 endograft (Cook; Bloomington, IN). Several successive next-generation reiterations of all of these devices have also gained approval. | Given the relative acceptance of the indications for thoracic endografts as an alternative to open procedures in the treatment of uncomplicated diseases of the descending thoracic aorta, experienced users of the devices now use them \"off-label\" in increasingly more complex indications, including use via \"hybrid-procedures\" in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. However, little long-term data are available at this time to support use in this fashion. | Next | Anatomy | A blood vessel has the following three layers: | Intima (inner layer made of endothelial cells) | Media (containing muscular elastic fibers) | Adventitia (outer connective tissue) | Aneurysms are either true or false. The wall of a true aneurysm involves all three layers, and the aneurysm is contained inside the endothelium. The wall of a false or pseudoaneurysm only involves the outer layer and is contained by the adventitia. An | aortic dissection | is formed by an intimal tear and is contained by the media; hence, it has a true lumen and a false lumen. | Ascending aortic aneurysms occur as proximally as the aortic annulus and as distally as the innominate artery. They may compress or erode into the sternum and ribs, causing pain or fistula. They also may compress the superior vena cava or airway. When symptomatic by rupture or dissection, they may involve the pericardium, aortic valve, or coronary arteries. They may rupture into the pericardium, causing tamponade. They may dissect into the aortic valve, causing aortic insufficiency, or into the coronary arteries, causing myocardial infarction. | Aortic arch aneurysms involve the aorta where the innominate artery, left carotid, and left subclavian originate. They may compress the innominate vein or airway. They may stretch the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, causing hoarseness. | Descending thoracic aneurysms originate beyond the left subclavian artery and may extend into the abdomen. Thoracoabdominal aneurysms are stratified according to the Crawford classification, as follows: | Type I involves the descending thoracic aorta from the left subclavian artery down to the abdominal aorta above the renal arteries | Type II extends from the left subclavian artery to the renal arteries and may continue distally to the aortic bifurcation | Type III begins at the mid-to-distal descending thoracic aorta and involves most of the abdominal aorta as far distal as the aortic bifurcation | Type IV extends from the upper abdominal aorta and all or none of the infrarenal aorta | Descending thoracic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aneurysms may compress or erode into surrounding structures, including the trachea, bronchus, esophagus, vertebral body, and spinal column. | Previous | Next | Pathophysiology | Aneurysms are usually defined as a localized dilation of an arterial segment greater that 50% its normal diameter. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the infrarenal segment (95%). The average size for an infrarenal aorta is 2 cm; therefore, AAAs are usually defined by diameters greater than 3 cm. The normal size for the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta is larger than that of the infrarenal aorta, and aneurysmal degeneration in these areas is defined accordingly. The average diameter of the mid-descending thoracic aorta is 26-28 mm, compared with 20-23 mm at the level of the celiac axis. | The occurrence and expansion of an aneurysm in a given segment of the arterial tree probably involves local hemodynamic factors and factors intrinsic to the arterial segment itself. | The medial layer of the aorta is responsible for much of its tensile strength and elasticity. Multiple structural proteins make up the normal medial layer of the human aorta. Of these, collagen and elastin are probably the most important. The elastin content of the ascending aorta is high and diminishes progressively in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. The infrarenal aorta has a relative paucity of elastin fibers in relation to collagen and compared with the thoracic aorta, possibly accounting for the increased frequency of aneurysms in this area. | In addition, the activity and amount of specific enzymes is increased, which leads to the degradation of these structural proteins. Elastic fiber fragmentation and loss with degeneration of the media result in weakening of the aortic wall, loss of elasticity, and consequent dilation. | Hemodynamic factors probably play a role in the formation of aortic aneurysms. The human aorta is a relatively low-resistance circuit for circulating blood. The lower extremities have higher arterial resistance, and the repeated trauma of a reflected arterial wave on the distal aorta may injure a weakened aortic wall and contribute to aneurysmal degeneration. Systemic hypertension compounds the injury, accelerates the expansion of known aneurysms, and may contribute to their formation. | Hemodynamically, the coupling of aneurysmal dilation and increased wall stress is defined by the law of Laplace. Specifically, the law of Laplace states that the (arterial) wall tension is proportional to the pressure times the radius of the arterial conduit (T = P × R). As diameter increases, wall tension increases, which contributes to increasing diameter. As tension increases, risk of rupture increases. Increased pressure (systemic hypertension) and increased aneurysm size aggravate wall tension and therefore increase the risk of rupture. | Aneurysm formation is probably the result of multiple factors affecting that arterial segment and its local environment. | Previous | Next | Etiology | Aneurysmal degeneration occurs more commonly in the aging population. Aging results in changes in collagen and elastin, which lead to weakening of the aortic wall and aneurysmal dilation. According to the law of Laplace, luminal dilation results in increased wall tension and the vicious cycle of progressive dilation and greater wall stress. Pathologic sequelae of the aging aorta include elastic fiber fragmentation and cystic medial necrosis. Arteriosclerotic (degenerative) disease is the most common cause of thoracic aneurysms. | A previous aortic dissection with a persistent false channel may produce aneurysmal dilation; such aneurysms are the second most common type. False aneurysms are more common in the descending aorta and arise from the extravasation of blood into a tenuous pocket contained by the aortic adventitia. Because of increasing wall stress, false aneurysms tend to enlarge over time. | Authorities strongly agree that genetics play a role in the formation of aortic aneurysms. Of first-degree relatives of patients with aortic aneurysms, 15% have an aneurysm. This appears especially true in first-degree relatives of female patients with aortic aneurysms. Thus, inherited disorders of connective tissue appear to contribute to the formation of aortic aneurysms. | Marfan syndrome | is a potentially lethal connective-tissue disease characterized by skeletal, heart valve, and ocular abnormalities. Individuals with this disease are at risk for aneurysmal degeneration, especially in the thoracic aorta. Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that results in abnormal fibrillin, a structural protein found in the human aorta. Patients with Marfan syndrome may develop annuloaortic ectasia of the sinuses of Valsalva, commonly associated with aortic valvular insufficiency and aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta. | Type IV | Ehlers-Danlos syndrome | results in a deficiency in the production of type III collagen, and individuals with this disease may develop aneurysms in any portion of the aorta. Imbalances in the synthesis and degradation of structural proteins of the aorta have also been discovered, which may be inherited or spontaneous mutations. | Atherosclerosis | may play a role. Whether atherosclerosis contributes to the formation of an aneurysm or whether they occur concomitantly is not established. Other causes of aortic aneurysms are infection (ie, bacterial [mycotic or syphilitic]), arteritis (ie, | giant cell | , | Takayasu | , | Kawasaki | , | Behçet | ), and trauma. Aortitis due to granulomatous disease is rare, but it can lead to the formation of aortic and, on occasion, pulmonary artery aneurysms. Aortitis caused by | syphilis | may cause destruction of the aortic media followed by aneurysmal dilation. | Traumatic dissection is a result of shearing from deceleration injury due to high speed motor vehicle accidents (MVA) or a fall from heights. The dissection occurs at a point of fixation, usually at the aortic isthmus (ie, at the ligamentum arteriosum, distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery), the ascending aorta, the aortic root, and the diaphragmatic hiatus. | The true etiology of aortic aneurysms is probably multifactorial, and the condition occurs in individuals with multiple risk factors. Risk factors include smoking, | chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | (COPD), | hypertension | , | atherosclerosis | , male gender, older age, | high body mass index (BMI) | , bicuspid or unicuspid aortic valves, genetic disorders, and family history. Aortic aneurysms are more common in men than in women and are more common in persons with COPD than in those without lung disease. | Previous | Next | Epidemiology | Although findings from autopsy series vary widely, the prevalence of aortic aneurysms probably exceeds 3-4% in individuals older than 65 years. | Death from aneurysmal rupture is one of the 15 leading causes of death in most series. The estimated incidence of thoracic aortic aneurysms is 6 cases per 100,000 person-years. In addition, the overall prevalence of aortic aneurysms has increased significantly in the last 30 years. This is partly due to an increase in diagnosis based on the widespread use of imaging techniques. However, the prevalence of fatal and nonfatal rupture has also increased, suggesting a true increase in prevalence. | Population-based studies suggest an incidence of acute aortic dissection of 3.5 per 100,000 persons; an incidence of thoracic aortic rupture of 3.5 per 100,000 persons; and an incidence of abdominal aortic rupture of 9 per 100,000 persons. An aging population probably plays a significant role. | Previous | Next | Prognosis | According to Culliford et al from 1982, | [13] | Cabrol et al from 1988, | [14] | and Donaldson and Ross from 1982, | [15] | the early hospital mortality following repair of ascending aneurysms is 4-10%. Contemporary surgical series demonstrated a continued wide range in operative mortality (2-17%). Stroke occurs in 2-5% of patients. | As would be expected, the early mortality after repair of arch aneurysms is considerably higher, approaching 25% in series by Crawford and Saleh from 1981, | [16] | by Crawford et al from 1979, | [17] | by Columbi et al from 1983, | [18] | by Ergin et al from 1982, | [19] | and by Galloway et al from 1989. | [20] | More contemporary results from Coselli and Ueda demonstrate an operative mortality of 6-12%. Stroke rate varied from 3-22%. Renal failure that necessitated dialysis occurred in 7% of patients. | The mortality after repair of descending thoracic aneurysms is lower, approximately 5-15% according to Crawford et al from 1981, | [16] | to Donahoo et al from 1977, | [21] | to Livesay et al from 1985, | [22] | and to Pressler and McNamara from 1985. | [2] | Contemporary results are unchanged, with 12-15% mortality. | As a group, including all repairs, according to Crawford et al from 1978, | [23] | Crawford et al from 1981, | [16] | and Kitamura et al from 1983, | [24] | survival rates after surgery for chronic aortic aneurysms are approximately 60% at 5 years and 30-40% at 10 years. | The longest follow-up data for a multicenter trial comparing endovascular and open techniques for management of TAAs are the results of a phase II multicenter trial for the GORE-TAG thoracic endovascular stent. A 1.5% 30-day mortality for endovascular repairs was demonstrated, temporary or permanent spinal cord paraplegia occurred in 3% of patients and stroke in 4% of patients. | [25] | At 2 years, aneurysm survival was 97% and overall survival 75%. | [25] | For the Medtronic Talent device, the incidence of paraplegia in the stent group was 0-9%; stroke, 3.7-8.1%; 30-day mortality, 2.9-9.7%; and procedural success, more than 95%. | [26] | When endovascular stent grafting was compared with open surgery for the GORE-TAG device, the rate of paraplegia was 3% in the stent group vs 14% in the open group; | [27] | operative mortality was 1% vs 6%, and early death was 2% vs 10%. | [28] | The patients in the stent group had shorter ICU and hospital stays, a quicker recovery time, and a lower incidence of major adverse events (except for vascular complications). Complications at 2 years included 4% proximal stent migration, 6% migration of the graft components, and 15% of patients had an endoleak. | Overall, survival rates were equivalent between the endovascular and open groups at both 2-years and 5-years, 80% and 70% respectively, but aneurysm-related survival significantly favored endovascular repairs at 5 years (97% vs 88%). | [29] | However, more contemporary \"real world\" experienced application has not been as supportive of this discrepancy, as noted by Greenberg et al, who discerned no significant differences in mortality or paraplegia in their population at 30 days (5.7 vs 8.3%) or at 1 year (15.6% vs 15.9%). | [30] | Midterm results comparing open descending thoracic aneurysm repair with endovascular stent grafting demonstrate less early operative mortality with endovascular repair (10% for stent grafting vs 15% for open repair) but similar late survival (actuarial survival rate at 48 months of 54% for stent grafting vs 64% for open repair). | Success with the results of endovascular repair of contained, degenerative TAAs of the descending aorta have created an environment to use endografts for treatment of arch aneurysms as well as acute catastrophes of both the arch and descending aortas. | Data from a multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective study of the use of endografts in emergency pathologies of the descending aorta have been published. | [31] | In situations that have reported mortality as high as 90%, the authors found that in the management of acute type B dissections, traumatic aortic tears, or ruptured aortic aneurysms, endovascular management compared to open resulted in a 14% vs 30% 30-day composite mortality/paraplegia rate. | Although freedom from aortic-related events was 84.5% at 1 year for the endovascular cohort, survival was only 66% with the subset of ruptured aneurysms have the worst survival (37%). Another multicenter trial evaluating use in ruptured aneurysms confirmed the perioperative mortality but also noted considerable neurologic complications (8%), procedure-related complications such as endoleak (18%), and ongoing aneurysm-related death (25% at 4 years). | [32] | Others have used endografts for arch pathologies, which usually necessitates a \"hybrid\" approach, a combination of endovascular and open techniques. Small (<30 patients) single-institution series with limited follow-up have reported perioperative mortality, stroke, and paraplegia rates of 0-25%, 0-25%, and 0-4%, respectively, questioning the durability and futility of the repairs. | [33, 34] | However, a series from a single tertiary care medical center highlighted the results of 400 consecutive patients, demonstrating a 6.5% and 53% 30-day and 4-year mortality, respectively, and a paraplegia and stroke rate of 4.5% and 3%, respectively. | [35] | Previous | Clinical Presentation","title":"Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Background, Anatomy, Pathophysiology"}}]],["wikem",[{"_index":"scrapy","_type":"items","_id":"a99ada8c9c8ebd795125324420dd7ef52f13b9b6","_score":1.5981677,"_source":{"url":"http://www.wikem.org/wiki/Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm","content":"Background | Infrarenal diameter >3cm or >50% increase in size of diameter | Rupture Risk | <4cm: low risk for rupture | 4-5cm: 5 year risk 3-12% | >5cm: 25-41% | Rupture poss at any size, most commonly >5cm | Risk Factors | Age | Prevalence is negligible in age < 50 yrs | Smoking | Risk factor most strongly assoc with AAA | Also promotes the rate of aneurysm growth | Family history | HTN | Clinical Features | Triad: pain + hypotension + pulsatile mass | Pain often described as sudden, severe, radiating to back | Syncope (10%) | Pain + AAA = rupture until proven otherwise | Acute abdomen + hypotension = possible rupture | Signs of | Retroperitoneal hemorrhage | Differential Diagnosis | Diffuse | Abdominal Pain | Peritonitis | Pancreatitis | Appendicitis | (early) | Abdominal aortic aneurysm | (leaking, ruptured) | Aortoenteric fisulta | Small bowel obstruction | Diabetic gastric paresis | Mesenteric ischemia | Diabetic Ketoacidosis | Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | Bowel perforation | Volvulus | Sickle Cell Crisis | Gastroenteritis | Lower Back Pain | Spine related | Acute ligamentous injury | Acute muscle strain | Disk herniation (Sciatica) | Degenerative joint disease | Spondylolithesis | Epidural compression syndromes | Spinal cord compression (non-traumatic) | Cauda equina syndrome | Conus medullaris syndrome | Epidural abscess (spinal) | Epidural hematoma (spinal) | Spinal fracture | Cancer metastasis | Spinal stenosis | Transverse myelitis | Vertebral osteomyelitis | Ankylosing spondylitis | Spondylolithesis | Discitis | Renal disease | Kidney stone | Pyelonephritis | Nephrolithiasis | Intra-abdominal | Abdominal aortic aneurysm | Ulcer | perforation | Retrocecal | appendicitis | Large bowel obstruction | Pancreatitis | Pelvic disease | PID | Other | Retroperitoneal hemorrhage/mass | Meningitis | Diagnosis | AAA | Ultrasound | ~100% sensitive for increased diameter | Cannot reliably visualize rupture | CT | ~100% sensitive for incr diameter and rupture | IV contrast is preferred but not essential | Management | Rupture | Do not waste time in ED trying to \"stabilize\" pt | Immediate surgery consultation/ go to OR | Crossmatch 6 units of pRBC | Pain control (avoid hypotension) | Antihypertensives (use with caution, goal SBP 110-120 mmHg or MAP 70-80) | [1] | Labetalol | : 20 mg IV, then 40-80 mg IV q10 min (max 300mg) | Esmolol | : Bolus 500 mcg/kg, then 50-200 mcg/kg/min | Nitroprusside | : 0.3 - 0.5 mcg/kg/min, titrate to max 10 mcg/kg/min | Controversial | Too little (ischemia), too much (increased bleeding) | Consider allowing for permissive hypotension (SBP 80-100) in conscious pt | Pressors | Norepi | 0.05mcg/kg/min IV; titrate by 0.02mcg/kg/min q5min | Phenylephrine | 100-180mcg/min; titrate by 25mcg/min q10min | Dopamine | 5mcg/kg/min; titrate by 5mcg/kg/min q10min | Asymptomatic | Prompt vascular surgery outpatient follow-up appt | Screening frequency: | 3-4 cm diameter: 12 months | 4-5 cm diameter: 6 months | 5-6 cm diameter: 1 month | Elective Surgery indicated if: | AAA > 5.5 cm in men | AAA > 5 cm in women | increase in size > 1 cm/year | increase in size > 5 mm/6 months | Disposition | Admit to OR in cases of ruptured OR | Vasc surg follow up in asymptomatic cases | References | ↑ | Reed, K.

Joint inflammation is usually accompanied by warmth, swelling (due to intra-articular fluid, or effusion), and uncommonly erythema. Pain may occur only with use or also at rest. Sometimes what is described by patients as joint pain can have an extra-articular source (eg, a periarticular structure or bone). | Polyarticular pain (polyarthralgia) involves multiple joints (pain in a single joint is discussed elsewhere—see | Pain in and Around a Single Joint | ). Polyarticular joint disorders may affect different joints at different times. When multiple joints are affected, the following distinction can be useful in differentiating among different disorders, particularly arthritides: | Oligoarticular: Involving ≤ 4 joints | Polyarticular: Involving > 4 joints | Pathophysiology | Articular sources of pain originate within the joint. Periarticular sources of pain originate in structures surrounding the joint (eg, tendons, ligaments, bursae, muscles). | Polyarticular pain caused by articular sources may result from the following: | Inflammation (eg, infection, crystal-induced arthritis, systemic inflammatory disorders such as RA and psoriatic arthritis) | Mechanical or other noninflammatory disorders (eg, osteoarthritis, hypermobility syndromes) | The synovium and joint capsule are major sources of pain within a joint. The synovial membrane is the main site affected by inflammation (synovitis). Pain affecting multiple joints in the absence of inflammation may be due to increased joint laxity and excessive trauma, as in benign hypermobility syndrome. | Polyarthritis may involve peripheral joints, axial joints (eg, sacroiliac, apophyseal, discovertebral, costovertebral), or both. | Etiology | Peripheral oligoarticular arthritis and polyarticular arthritis are more commonly associated with a systemic infection (eg, viral) or systemic inflammatory disorder (eg, RA) than is monoarticular arthritis. A specific cause can usually be determined (see Table: | Some Causes of Pain in = 5 Joints* | and | Some Causes of Pain in = 4 Joints | ); however, sometimes the arthritis is transient and resolves before a diagnosis can be clearly established. Axial involvement suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (also called spondyloarthritis—see | Overview of Seronegative Spondyloarthropathies | ) but can also occur in RA (affecting the cervical spine but not the lumbar spine). | Acute polyarticular arthritis is most often due to the following: | Infection (usually viral) | Flare-up of a systemic inflammatory disorder | Gout or pseudogout | Chronic polyarticular arthritis in adults is most often due to the following: | RA | Seronegative spondyloarthropathy (usually ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or enteropathic arthritis) | Noninflammatory polyarticular pain in adults is most often due to the following: | Osteoarthritis | Chronic polyarthralgia in adults is caused most often by RA and osteoarthritis. | Chronic polyarticular arthralgia in children is most often due to the following: | Juvenile idiopathic arthritis | Some Causes of Pain in ≥ 5 Joints* | Cause | Suggestive Findings |

Extra-articular symptoms and findings, which may suggest specific systemic inflammatory disorders, should also be sought and evaluated, particularly if there is joint inflammation. | History | History of present illness | should identify characteristics of joint pain, associated joint symptoms, and systemic symptoms. Among important joint symptom characteristics are the acuity of onset (eg, abrupt, gradual), temporal patterns (eg, diurnal variation, persistent vs intermittent), duration (eg, acute vs chronic), and exacerbating and mitigating factors (eg, rest, activity). Patients should be specifically asked about unprotected sexual contact (indicating risk of infectious bacterial arthritis with disseminated gonococcal infection) and tick bites or residence in or travel to a Lyme-endemic area. | Review of systems | should be complete in order to identify extra-articular symptoms that may suggest specific disorders (see Table: | Some Causes of Pain in = 5 Joints* | , | Some Causes of Pain in = 4 Joints | , and | Some Suggestive Findings in Polyarticular Joint Pain | ). | Past medical history | and family history should identify known systemic inflammatory disorders and other conditions capable of causing joint symptoms (see Table: | Some Causes of Pain in = 5 Joints* | and | Some Causes of Pain in = 4 Joints | ). Some systemic inflammatory disorders are more prevalent in families with specific genetic profiles. | Physical examination | The physical examination should be reasonably complete, evaluating all major organ systems (eg, skin and nails, eyes, genitals, mucosal surfaces, heart, lungs, abdomen, nose, neck, lymph nodes, and neurologic system) as well as the musculoskeletal system. Vital signs are reviewed for fever. | Examination of the head should note any signs of eye inflammation (eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis) and nasal or oral lesions. Skin should be inspected for rashes and lesions (eg, ecchymoses, skin ulcers, psoriatic plaques, purpura, malar rash). The patient is also evaluated for lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. | Cardiopulmonary examination should note any signs that suggest pleuritis, pericarditis, or valve abnormalities (eg, murmur, pericardial rub, muffled heart sounds, bibasilar dullness consistent with pleural effusion). | Genital examination should note any discharge, ulcers, or other findings consistent with sexually transmitted diseases. | Musculoskeletal examination should start by distinguishing articular from periarticular or other connective tissue or muscular tenderness. Joint examination begins with inspection for deformities, erythema, swelling, or effusion and then proceeds to palpation for joint effusions, warmth, and point tenderness. Passive and active range of motion should be evaluated. Crepitus may be felt during joint flexion and/or extension. Comparison with the contralateral unaffected joint often helps detect more subtle changes. Examination should note whether the distribution of affected joints is symmetric or asymmetric. Painful joints can also be compressed without flexing or extending them. | Periarticular structures also should be examined for involvement of tendons, bursae, or ligaments, such as discrete, soft swelling at the site of a bursa (bursitis) or point tenderness at the insertion of a tendon (tendinitis). | Red flags | The following findings are of particular concern: | Joint warmth, swelling, and erythema | Any extra-articular symptoms (eg, fever, rash, chills, plaques, mucosal ulcers, conjunctivitis, uveitis, murmur, purpura) | Interpretation of findings | An important initial determination, based mainly on carefully done physical examination, is whether pain originates in the joints, in other adjacent structures (eg, bones, tendons, bursae, muscles), both (eg, as in gout), or other structures. Tenderness or swelling at only one side of a joint, or away from the joint line, suggests an extra-articular origin (eg, tendons or bursae); localized joint line tenderness or more diffuse involvement of the joint suggests an intra-articular cause. Compressing the joint without flexing or extending it is not particularly painful in patients with tendinitis or bursitis but is quite painful in those with arthritis. Pain that worsens with active but not passive joint motion may indicate tendinitis or bursitis (extra-articular); intra-articular inflammation generally restricts active and passive range of joint motion significantly. | Another important determination is whether joints are inflamed. Pain during rest and on initiating activity suggests joint inflammation, whereas pain worsened by movement and relieved by rest suggests mechanical or noninflammatory disorders (eg, osteoarthritis). Increased warmth and erythema also suggest inflammation, but these findings are often insensitive, so their absence does not rule out inflammation. | Clinical findings of prolonged morning stiffness, stiffness after prolonged inactivity (gel phenomenon), nontraumatic joint swelling, and fever or unintentional weight loss suggest a systemic inflammatory disorder involving the joints. Pain that is diffuse, vaguely described, and affects myofascial structures without signs of inflammation suggests fibromyalgia. | Symmetry of joint involvement can be a clue. Involvement tends to be symmetric in RA, whereas asymmetric involvement is more suggestive of psoriatic arthritis, gout, and reactive arthritis or enteropathic arthritis. | Examination of the hand joints may yield other clues (see Table: | Some Suggestive Findings in Polyarticular Joint Pain | ) that help differentiate osteoarthritis from RA (see Table: | Differential Features of the Hand in RA and Osteoarthritis | ) or that may suggest other disorders. | Spinal pain in the presence of peripheral arthritis suggests a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or enteropathic arthritis) but can occur in RA (usually with cervical spinal pain). New-onset oligoarthritis plus spinal pain is particularly likely to be a seronegative spondyloarthropathy if the patient has a family history of the same disorder. Eye redness and pain and low back pain suggest ankylosing spondylitis. Prior plaque psoriasis in a patient with new onset of oligoarthritis strongly suggests psoriatic arthritis. | Some Suggestive Findings in Polyarticular Joint Pain | Finding | Possible Cause | General findings | Coexisting tendinitis | RA, disseminated gonococcal infection, psoriatic arthritis, gout, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (when begins at age ≤ 16) | Conjunctivitis, diarrhea, skin and genital lesions | Reactive arthritis | Fever | Infectious arthritis, gout, systemic inflammatory disorders (eg, SLE, RA) | Malaise, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy | Acute HIV infection, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Still disease) | Oral and genital lesions | Behçet disease, reactive arthritis | Raised silver plaques | Psoriatic arthritis | Recent pharyngitis and migrating arthritis | Rheumatic fever | Recent vaccination or use of a blood product | Serum sickness | Skin lesions, abdominal pain, respiratory symptoms, and mucosal lesions | Systemic vasculitis | Urethritis | Reactive arthritis or disseminated gonococcal infection | Hand findings (see Table: | Differential Features of the Hand in RA and Osteoarthritis | ) | Asymmetric involvement of PIP and DIP joints with diffuse swelling of fingers (dactylitis) and/or nail pitting | Psoriatic arthritis | Tophi plus asymmetric involvement of any hand joints | Chronic gout | Bony enlargement of the PIP (Bouchard nodes) or DIP (Heberden nodes) joints | First carpometacarpal (CMC) involvement | Osteoarthritis | Raynaud phenomenon | Systemic sclerosis, SLE, or mixed connective tissue disease | Scaling rash, often with plaque formation, over extensor surfaces of MCP and PIP joints (Gottron papules) | Dermatomyositis | Laxity of multiple finger tendons that can result in reducible finger deformities (Jaccoud arthropathy) | SLE | Symmetric involvement of PIP and MCP joints, particularly with swan-neck or boutonnière deformities | RA | Thickening of the skin over the fingers (sclerodactyly) and flexion contractures | Systemic sclerosis | DIP | = | distal interphalangeal; MCP | = | metacarpophalangeal; PIP | = | proximal interphalangeal. | Differential Features of the Hand in RA and Osteoarthritis | Criteria | RA | Osteoarthritis | Joint swelling | Common | Synovial, capsular, soft tissue | Uncommon | Possibly mild swelling with flare-ups | Bony hypertrophy | Only in late stages | Common, often with irregular spurs | DIP involvement | Rare | Frequent | MCP involvement | Frequent | Unusual | Possibly significant MCP involvement in hemochromatosis | PIP involvement | Frequent | Frequent | Wrist involvement | Frequent | Rare, however involvement of first carpometacarpal joint (common) sometimes perceived as wrist pain | CMC = carpometacarpal; DIP | = | distal interphalangeal; MCP | = | metacarpophalangeal; PIP | = | proximal interphalangeal. | Adapted from Bilka PJ: Physical examination of the arthritic patient. | Bulletin on the Rheumatic Diseases | 20:596–599, 1970. | Testing | The following tests are particularly important: | Arthrocentesis | Usually ESR and C-reactive protein | Serologic testing | In chronic arthritis, x-rays | Arthrocentesis is mandatory in most patients with a new effusion to rule out infection and identify crystals. It can also help distinguish between an inflammatory and a noninflammatory process. Synovial fluid examination includes WBC count with differential, Gram stain and cultures, and microscopic examination for crystals using polarized light. Finding crystals in synovial fluid confirms crystal-induced arthritis but does not rule out coexisting infection. A noninflammatory synovial fluid (eg, WBC count of  50,000/µL) in both infectious and crystal-induced arthritis. Synovial fluid WBC counts in systemic inflammatory disorders causing polyarthritis are most often between about 1,000 and 50,000/µL. | If the specific diagnosis cannot be established based on the history and examination, additional tests may be needed. ESR and C-reactive protein can be done to help determine whether the arthritis is inflammatory. Elevated ESR and C-reactive protein levels suggest inflammation but are nonspecific, particularly in older adults. Findings are more specific if values are high during inflammatory flare-ups and normal between flare-ups. | Once a diagnosis of a systemic inflammatory disorder is clinically suspected, supportive serologic testing for antinuclear antibodies, double-stranded DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may assist in making the diagnosis. Specific tests should | only | be ordered to provide support for a specific diagnosis, such as SLE, ANCA-associated vasculitis, or RA. | If arthritis is chronic, x-rays are typically done to look for signs of joint damage. | Other tests may be needed to identify specific disorders (see Table: | Some Causes of Pain in = 5 Joints* | and | Some Causes of Pain in = 4 Joints | ). | Treatment | The underlying disorder is treated whenever possible. Systemic inflammatory diseases may require either immunosuppression or antibiotics as determined by the diagnosis. Joint inflammation is usually treated symptomatically with NSAIDs. Pain without inflammation is usually more safely treated with | acetaminophen | . Joint immobilization with a splint or sling can sometimes relieve pain. Heat or cold therapy may be analgesic in inflammatory joint diseases. Because chronic polyarthritis can lead to inactivity and secondary muscle atrophy, continued physical activity should be encouraged. | Geriatrics Essentials | Osteoarthritis is by far the most common cause of arthritis in older people. RA most commonly begins between ages 30 and 40, but in up to one third of patients, it develops after the age of 60. Because cancers can cause paraneoplastic polyarthritis, cancer should be considered in older adults in whom new-onset RA is suspected, particularly if the onset is acute, if the lower extremities are predominantly affected, or if there is bone tenderness. Polymyalgia rheumatica should also be considered in patients > 50 who have hip and shoulder girdle stiffness and pain, even if patients have arthritis of peripheral joints (most often the hands). | Key Points | The differential diagnosis of polyarticular joint pain can be narrowed by considering which and how many joints are affected, whether inflammation is present, whether joint distribution is symmetric, and whether any extra-articular symptoms or signs are present. | Chronic polyarthritis is most often caused by juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children and chronic polyarthralgia is most often caused by osteoarthritis and RA in adults. | Acute polyarticular arthritis is most often due to infection, gout, or a flare of a systemic inflammatory disease. | Arthrocentesis is mandatory in most cases of a new effusion to rule out infection, diagnose crystal-induced arthropathy, and help distinguish between an inflammatory and noninflammatory process. | Last full review/revision December 2013 by Alexandra Villa-Forte, MD, MPH | Resources In This Article | Table 1 | Some Causes of Pain in ≥ 5 Joints* | Table 2 | Some Causes of Pain in ≤ 4 Joints | Table 3 | Some Suggestive Findings in Polyarticular Joint Pain | Table 4 | Differential Features of the Hand in RA and Osteoarthritis | Drugs Mentioned In This Article | Drug Name | Select Brand Names | acetaminophen | TYLENOL | Pain in and Around Joints | Pain in and Around a Single Joint | Pain in Multiple Joints | NOTE: | This is the Professional Version. | CONSUMERS: | Click here for the Consumer Version | NOTE: | This is the Professional Version. | DOCTORS: | Click here for the Consumer Version | Pain in and Around a Single Joint | Was This Page Helpful? | Yes | No | Introduction to Autoimmune Rheumatic Disorders","title":"Pain in Multiple Joints"}},{"_index":"scrapy","_type":"items","_id":"2377ec9a170b8162fe4195d5630809b384913aef","_score":0.15050773,"_source":{"url":"http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/geriatrics/prevention-of-disease-and-disability-in-the-elderly/prevention-of-disease-in-the-elderly","content":"Prevention of Disease in the Elderly | By | James T.

Disease management is enhanced by using disease-specific practice guidelines and protocols. Several disease management programs have been developed: | Disease-specific care management: A specially trained nurse, working with a primary care physician or geriatrician, coordinates protocol-driven care, arranges support services, and teaches patients. | Chronic care clinics: Patients with the same chronic disease are taught in groups and are visited by a health care practitioner; this approach can help patients with diabetes achieve better glucose control. | Specialists: Patients with a chronic disease that is difficult to stabilize can be referred to a specialist. This approach works best when the specialist and primary care physician work collaboratively. | Patients with the following chronic disorders, which are common among the elderly, can potentially benefit from tertiary prevention. | Arthritis | Arthritis (primarily osteoarthritis; much less commonly, RA) affects about half of people | ≥ | 65. It leads to impaired mobility and increases risk of osteoporosis, aerobic and muscular deconditioning, falls, and pressure ulcers. | Osteoporosis | Tests to measure bone density can detect osteoporosis before it leads to a fracture. Ca and vitamin D supplementation, exercise, and, if needed, cessation of cigarette smoking can help prevent osteoporosis from progressing, and treatment can prevent new fractures. | Diabetes | Hyperglycemia, especially when the glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A | 1c | ) concentration is | > | 7.9% for at least 7 yr, increases the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and coronary artery disease. Glycemic treatment goals should be adjusted based on patient preferences, comorbid conditions, and life expectancy. For example, appropriate HbA | 1c | goals might be | 10 yr | Control of hypertension and dyslipidemia in diabetic patients is particularly important. | Patient education and foot examinations at each visit can help prevent foot ulcers. | Vascular disorders | Elderly patients with a history of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease are at high risk of disabling events. Risk can be reduced by aggressive management of vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, obesity, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia). | Heart failure | Morbidity due to heart failure is significant among the elderly, and the mortality rate is higher than that of many cancers. Appropriate, aggressive treatment, especially of systolic dysfunction, reduces functional decline, hospitalization, and mortality rate. | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) | Smoking cessation, appropriate use of inhalers and other drugs, and patient education regarding energy-conserving behavioral techniques can decrease the number and severity of exacerbations of COPD leading to hospitalization. | Last full review/revision September 2013 by James T.
